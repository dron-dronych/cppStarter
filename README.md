# cppStarter
Long-lived dream to learn the powerful beast, C++.

- Python is good for fast prototyping and research.
- Java's good production-ready solution.
- C++ is just fast, so fast other languages use it as part of implementation.

-- The world of no exceptions but errors as codes<br>
-- Compilation for a predefined platform<br>
-- Linkers, headers, user-defined namespaces, and no garbage collectors with full control of your memory...<br>
-- Implementation of trivial (not readily available) in other higher level languages operations yourself<br>
-- 100 lines of code and 900 lines of compilation errors<br>

more thoughts to come...

Source in this repository is compiled in the most basic way for now, no extra compiler flags or the C++ standard reference flags:

`clang++ [sourceFileName.cpp] -o sourceFileName`

`g++ [sourceFileName.cpp] -o sourceFileName`
