Long-lived dream to learn the powerful beast, C++.

- Python is good for fast prototyping and research.
- Java's good production-ready solution.
- C++ is just fast, so fast other languages use it as part of implementation.

-- The world of no exceptions but errors as codes<br>
-- Compilation for a predefined platform<br>
-- Linkers, headers, user-defined namespaces, and no garbage collectors with full control of your memory...<br>

more thoughts to come...
